= How to customize PDF Invoice templates? =

InvoiceBoo offers a couple of PDF Invoice templates which provide the necessary layout and content customization options.

Template files are located inside **/plugins/invoiceboo/templates** folder. Please copy the template file you require to your active theme to keep your customization intact after plugin updates. You can copy them to either one of these locations:

* yourtheme/templates/ or
* yourtheme/

Please be aware that if a new InvoiceBoo version is released with an updated template file, you may have to replace the old template file with the new one to maintain compatibility.
